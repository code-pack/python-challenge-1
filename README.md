# Python Challenges Bruhh!!!

### Two Projects:

- PyBank. Creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company.
- PyPoll. To create a Python program to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process (they are doing it one-by-one lol).

### Two Extra Projects:

- PyBoss. Creating a Python script able to convert the employee records to the required format.
- PyParagraph. To create a Python script to automate the analysis of any such passage of a text file using the defined metrics.
